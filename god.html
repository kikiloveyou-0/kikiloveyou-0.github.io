        It is strongly believed that god is the perfection, 
        the creator of the universe.
        Almost all religion admits that god is all knowing, all powerful, and all loving.
        Without questioning the statement that god is inborn for the human, god was always the
        answer to the meaning of ones life. 
        Not many besides epicure questioned the powers of god because either they assumed the 
        rightness of relgion, or they were debating about god in the context of his all knowing.
        But one must ask himself before beliving: Is god good? Does he care? Does he love me? Does he know about me?
        Of course this sentence is quiet meaningless because it assumes that religions are wrong about the  powers of god.
        Of course, religous people will often justify the infinite power of god by saying that he is the creator of the universe.
        But this explanation is doing nothing but assumes a statement.
        One must conceive of god as not all powerful, even more, powerless. 
        Applying some dogmas (such as god is allpowerful) from religions, and assuming that god is represented by "G", and his capabilitys "C" the subsequent in G, 
        No correlations can be logically found between the G and C, altough C is in G, we cannot determine that G is aware of C, neither uses C, neither understands C.

        Without applying any dogmas from religions, and assuming that god is represented by "G", and his capabilitys "C" not in G,
        litteraly no correlations can be found between those two.
        What is mean is that we simply assume that god is real, but if we assume a supposedly creator of the universe, 
        we cannot also assume his powers, we cannot assume his love towards us and we can't actually assume anything about him.
        The debate about the question of god becomes steril, because we are juste reasoning with linear logic.
        If god is, as said by some religions, at the image of the human, why would it be impossible to conceive a god that hates? 
        That is sad? That is tired? That likes and dislikes? 
        <br>
        <br>

        One must imagine god as a the person that you meet at your local bar.

        [sohn-dehrr]
        <br>
        (n.) the realization that each passerby has a life as vivid and complex as your own.
        <br>
        <br>

        God does not care about me, neither he loves me. He may care and love, but simply assuming it 
        Is no way to go.
        <br>
        One must live detached from the love of god, he must live, with the idea of its existance potentially if he wants to,
        but he must alway keep in mind that he will get nothing from his creator.
        Mather of a fact, if god is all loving and all powerful, he will have to beg me to love him.
